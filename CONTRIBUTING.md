# How to contribute:

Thanks for taking interest in this framework! It's a small personal project that I plan to use and I released it in hope to help others
I'm always learning and would be happy to get help and you can learn too ^^

## Some ways you can contribute:
- Improve the code by reducing the size and avoid repetition where possible
- Improve the instructions on the demo page. I tried to make it as detailed as possible but if you find any ways to make it better even by:
- - Grammar, typos, missing things and better explanation: mostly I wrote this at night while sleep deprived so there may be a lot of grammar and syntax errors and over-explanation of rather simple things because I do that sometimes (a lot)
- - Improving the examples: if you think they can be done better or have new simple and helpful elements you made using this don't hesitate to open a pull request!
- - Improve navigation. The page is long and navigating it can be annoying for people that don't have the time to read it all.
- Find out the gzipped size cause I'm lazy to do it
- Creating an extra .css with elements that aren't included but would be nice to have in [extras](/extras)
- - Examples:  A progress bar, CSS-only nav bar
- - Make sure the elements are small and don't require any other external CSS or pollyfils
- - An extra section in the demo page about it would be nice


## Making pull requests:
> #### I recommend reading this [easy getting started guide](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) for understanding how to make contributions!
- If you're making fixes to the demo page or minor fixes to the CSS that doesn't add any more feature you can submit the edits directly by making a pull request like the guide above shows
- If you're adding new things to the CSS make sure that it doesn't add much size. I plan to keep all of the 5 CSS files under 4kb minified.
- - If you're deleting make sure it keeps it nice
- mono/color is focused on having two simple themes dark and light but you can make more based on your liking you can add them to the extras directory in this repository
- mono/color is meant to be readable and easy to use for blogs and documentation
- if you're adding something that would be nice for web apps add it in the extras directory ^^

Thanks again for your interest and last but not least you may also contribute to this guide with fixes ^^
