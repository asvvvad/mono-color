a small, simple and beautiful CSS framework built with responsivity, readability, and a dual-theme in mind.

It's perfect for a blog or a documentation site and can be used for anything else aswell.
It's very responsive and looks neat on any resolution.
Based on [Starveling](https://github.com/any-code/starveling/) and [lit](https://ajusa.github.io/lit/), providing only necessary elements while still looking great and customizable.

## mono/color is split into two:

### mono / 1.6kb minified (not gzipped, including both themes)
Can be used alone, it includes dark & light theme with no colors, you can use only one theme too. Only default html elements with a basic button.
Good for a simple responsive blog. 

### color / 1.9kb minified (not gzipped)
Adds grids, cards, colors, useful utilities and badges.
Great for a simple documentation page or a web app.
