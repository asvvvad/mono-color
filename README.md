a small, simple and beautiful CSS framework built with responsivity, readability, and a dual-theme in mind.

It's perfect for a blog or a documentation site and can be used for anything else aswell.
It's very responsive and looks neat on any resolution.
Based on [Starveling](https://github.com/any-code/starveling/) and [lit](https://ajusa.github.io/lit/), providing only necessary elements while still looking great and customizable.

## mono/color is split into two:

### mono / 1.7kb minified (not gzipped)
Can be used alone for simple pages it contains dark and light theme, basic html elements styling, and the .btn, .primary, .default class for anchor buttons and for reverse element theme

### color / 1.9kb minified (not gzipped)
Adds grids, cards, colors, utilities and badges
